				Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has been a tedious task that
				required a keen eye for typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.

					Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my

			<p>
				The
				<code>@tailwindcss/typography</code>
				plugin is our attempt to give you what you
				<em>actually</em>
				want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.

			<h2>What to expect from here on out</h2>

				Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Dignissimos nemo itaque culpa distinctio, sed

			<ol>
				<li>We want everything to look good out of the box.</li>
				<li>Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.</li>
				<li>
					Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with
					two items.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now we're going to try out another header style.</p>
			<h3>Typography should be easy</h3>
			<p>It's probably important that images look okay here by default as well:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>So here is the first item in this list.</li>
				<li>In this example we're keeping the items short.</li>
				<li>Later, we'll use longer, more complex list items.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>And that's the end of this section.</p>
			<h2>What if we stack headings?</h2>
			<h3>We should make sure that looks good, too.</h3>
			<p>
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Magnam voluptatem, quo aperiam nisi, error
				provident consectetur ex, culpa voluptates minus nihil voluptatibus natus nemo quibusdam laboriosam
				exercitationem dolor. Eveniet, assumenda?
			</p>
			<h3>When a heading comes after a paragraph …</h3>
			<p>
				When a heading comes after a paragraph, we need a bit more space, like I already mentioned above. Now
				let's see what a more complex list would look like.
			</p>
			<p>
				The most annoying thing about lists in Markdown is that
				<code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
				elements aren't given a child
				<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
				tag unless there are multiple paragraphs in the list item. That means I have to worry about styling that
				annoying situation too.
